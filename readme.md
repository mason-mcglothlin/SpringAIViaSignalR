# Spring AI via SignalR

I want to write AI's for [Spring](https://springrts.com/) in C#. Others may want to use VB.NET, or F#, or JavaScript, or TypeScript, or Iron Python. This project is an attempt to write a SignalR server that allows any platform that has a SignalR client to be able to write an AI for Spring.

Since I'm most familiar with Java out of the languages currently supported by Spring for AI's. However, eventually my goal is to have it as a native Spring AI interface and eliminate the Java middleman.
