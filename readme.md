# Spring AI via SignalR

I want to write AI's for [Spring](https://springrts.com/) in C#. Others may want to use VB.NET, or F#, or JavaScript, or TypeScript, or Iron Python. This project is an attempt to write a SignalR server that allows any platform that has a SignalR client to be able to write an AI for Spring.
